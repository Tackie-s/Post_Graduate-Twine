You enroll in three contrasting courses: Introduction to Data Science, Creative Writing Workshop, and Environmental Studies.

- In Data Science, you visualize climate data and feel the thrill of patterns emerging.
- In Creative Writing, your poem about city life wins praise from peers.
- In Environmental Studies, a field trip to wetlands makes you think about sustainability.

Each class awakens a different part of you—logic, creativity, and advocacy.

You ignore the warning signs. You skip meals, push aside friends, and chase perfection. At first, your grades soar, but soon your energy crashes.

You end up taking a semester off. The world doesn’t end, but it hurts. You return, more careful this time—but the experience stays with you.

You take a step back. You breathe. You start going on walks, journaling, or visiting the campus wellness center. You remind yourself that college isn’t just about grades—it’s about growth.

With your new habits, you find balance. You graduate on time, surrounded by people who supported you. Your journey was full of twists, but you came out stronger.

You chose to take a gap year—a break from school to explore, learn, and grow. Your backpack is ready, your itinerary is loose, and your heart is full of possibilities.

You can either travel abroad, discovering new cultures and places, or stay closer to home and volunteer for a cause you care about.

What will you do?

You decided to jump straight into the workforce after high school. It wasn’t an easy decision, especially when so many of your friends were talking about college applications, dorm rooms, and majors. But for you, earning money and building real-world experience feels like the right move.

You polish up your resume with the help of your school’s career counselor, borrow your cousin’s blazer, and start applying. The interviews are nerve-wracking, but one day, your phone buzzes—an offer! You land a job as an entry-level assistant at a local company.

On your first day, you meet your manager, learn how to use the office coffee machine, and get your ID badge. You’re officially part of the adult world. 💼

You arrive on campus with your suitcase, your schedule, and a lot of nerves. The halls are buzzing with students—some rushing to class, others lounging on the lawn with laptops and coffee. You take a deep breath and remember why you came: for a better future, for a chance to grow, and maybe even for a fresh start.

Orientation is a whirlwind. You meet your roommate, explore the dining hall, and sit through back-to-back icebreakers. Then comes the big question—your major. This decision will shape your college journey.
